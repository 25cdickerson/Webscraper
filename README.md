# Web Scraper
## Overview
This was web-scraper was created to automate a process I need to do for a paper. In this paper, I was analysing the misogynistic language used in modern rap lyrics.

## Process
First I had to find a language to write this in. I chose javascript because I believe it is the easiest procedural language to use when dealing with webpages because
it is used to automate processes within webpages so often. After I found a language, I wanted to find a library to make things a little easier for me. I ended up finding
"Puppeteer" which is a library that allows you to "open" a webpage and access elements from that webpage using xml code addresses. I put each lyric site with the lyrics
into an array and had it go through and access elements in a for loop. The javascript would then output the count of each word and sort by gender as well. These results
were then inputed into google sheets where I did visualization for my paper.

## Results
If you want to read the paper, contact me and I can send it to you.

## Conclusion
I got a lot out of this. One thing I learned was almost anything can be automated. While talking to my classmates about this paper, I heard many people who were doing
things by hand that could be automated. I think this can be translated into everyday life, a lot of my mundane tasks can be automated if I just sit down and write
scripts for them. Another thing I learned was that I can teach myself things if I just put some time and effort into it. At the beginning of this, I had never done
anything with webscrapers. Although I have extensive experience with writing websites, I had never actually accessed someone else's work from the internet.
It took me a couple hours of research to understand exactly how to do things but after that it was smooth sailing.
